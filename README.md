Welcome to the House Pricing Prediction App! This web app allows you to predict the price of a house based on its features like area, number of bedrooms, and other important factors. The app uses machine learning, specifically XGBoost, to give an accurate price estimate for any house.

Features üåü
Price Prediction: Simply enter the details of a house (like area, number of rooms, parking spaces, etc.), and get an instant price estimate.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit, the app is interactive and easy to use. No coding experience needed to get started!

Machine Learning Model: The app uses an XGBoost model that‚Äôs trained to predict house prices based on historical data.

Real-Time Prediction: As soon as you fill in the details, the app predicts the price in real time!

Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
Streamlit: For building the web app interface.

XGBoost: For creating the machine learning model that predicts house prices.

Pandas: For managing and manipulating the data.

Scikit-Learn: For preprocessing the data and evaluating the model.

Pickle: For saving and loading the trained model and label encoders.
